Hello, I am Miles.

I'm a software developer based in Portland, Ore. This is my attempt getting better at writing.


Particularly, I'd like to get better at writing about software development and some of the hobbies that I'm passionate about like mushroom hunting, hiking, and surfing.

This blog is written using [hugo](gohugo.io) with [researcher](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher) theme. It's deployed to S3 and fronted by CloudFront. The source along with the Github actions can be found [here](https://github.com/iammiles/iammiles-blog).
